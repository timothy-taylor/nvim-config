### nvim config

just realized you can write Neovim configs in Lua, so decided to take the plunge and move over to it from my pretty lightweight Vim setup.

clone this repo in `~/.config/nvim/` and require it by adding `require("tgt")` to `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`

I used LunarVim's 'Neovim From Scratch' repo and ThePrimeagen's 'Your first vimrc' YT video as the starting point / main inspiration for this config.
